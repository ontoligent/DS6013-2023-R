-   All slide decks will be integrated into a single slide deck for presentation purposes.
-   Acknowledge clients on title slide.
-   Represent the argument of your paper in reduced form. That is, use the structure of your paper as a framework for the structure of your presentation.
-   Make sure all graphics are legible. Use the maximum space available and make sure any labels use large enough fonts to be readable by the audience.
