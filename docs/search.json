    "text": "Overview\n\nYou will produce a publishable paper that presents the results of your capstone project.\nInformation on the form, content, and preparation of your paper for publication are provided in this document.\n\n\n\nFormat\n\nLength: 6 pages maximum\nPaper size: 8.5” by 11”\nSee Templates below for details on fonts, line spacing, etc.\n\n\n\nTemplates\n\nMicrosoft Word\nLaTeX\nLaTeX Bibliography Files\nOverleaf (This is an online editor that makes producing LaTeX documents easy.)\n\n\n\nAbstracts\n\nRevise your original abstract to correspond with the state of your research at the time of writing the final paper.\nAbstracts describe the paper in condensed form. As a guide, it should address the following:\n\nMotivation (Why): Provide context for the work and reasons it is important. This is a general statement.\nFocus (What): Write a short statement of the specific focus of the work presented.\nMethodology (How): Describe the methodology used to approach the problem of interest. If the focus of your work is on designing a system, this section frequently focuses on your design (\"how\" the focus of the work is addressed).\nResults: Identify results. If results are forthcoming, state what you expect to have as results by the time the final paper is due. If the focus of your work is on designing a system, then Results frequently focuses on validation/testing results.\n\nYour abstract should be 100-500 words.\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\nCite team members in alphabetical order by last (family) name.\nNote that clients are rarely authors. Clients are cited as authors only if they make a direct contribution to the paper.\nCapstone advisors are occasionally listed as authors. If so, they are listed last. Include them only if they made a direct contribution to the paper and if they wish to be included.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAll contributors not listed authors should be mentioned in an acknowledgments note.\nClients may opt out of this. Be sure to ask your clients if they want to be acknowledged.\nIf they do not wish to be mentioned, use generic nouns to designate their organizations and roles.\n\n\n\nCiting Work\n\nAs a rule, all written or presented material must be your own unless you explicitly cite the work of others. \nYou may not copy or use the work of anyone else without proper citation.\nCited material must be correctly referenced in your reports using IEEE format.\nIf you have questions about whether something counts as your own work or not, consult the instructor.\n\n\n\nVoice and Style\n\nDo not use the first person. Use either second person plural (“we”) of passive voice where appropriate.\nDo not narrate trials and errors. Describe the state of your project and understandings at the time of writing.\nUse direct and simple language. Avoid superfluous constructions. For example, instead of “We developed a model with the purpose of establishing a foundation for ...” say “Our model established ...”\n\n\n\nCode\n\nName all important code packages used.\n\n\n\nFigures and Tables\n\nUse block diagrams to describe data flow (pipeline) when appropriate.\nShow mathematical formulae for core methods.\nTables should be legible and within the page’s columns.\nDiagrams should be labeled clearly, crisp, and readable.\n\n\n\nGeneric Outline\nThese elements are often included in capstone papers. You may consider collapsing some of these to reduce the length of your paper. For example, you may be able to include references to previous work in your research question description, or you may combine the data description with the methodology.\n\nIntroduction / Project Goal / Research Questions\nLiterature Review / Background / Related Work\nData Description\nMethodology\nResults\nDiscussion\nConclusion / Future Work / Recommendations\nAcknowledgements\n\n\n\nExample Papers\n\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000739/all-proceedings/popular\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7937744\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7489317\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7489303\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8374722\n\n\n\nDataflow diagrams\n\n\n\nRaiker, J.

That is, use the structure of your paper as a framework for the structure of your presentation.\nMake sure all graphics are legible. Use the maximum space available and make sure any labels use large enough fonts to be readable by the audience.\nIf you have trouble embedding a video clip (not recommended) in PowerPoint, use a link instead.\n\n\n\nAbout the Presentation\n\nPresentations will be 7 minutes long, followed by 3 minutes of questions and answers.\nTime limits are strict — be sure to practice your presentation as a group before presentation day.\nThere will be a timekeeper in the audience notifying you of how much time you have left.\nDuring Q & A, students from the next scheduled will queue up for their talk. Details for this process will be announced on presentation day.\nEach student should present at least 1 slide.\n\n\n\nEvaluation\n\nPresentations will be peer-evaluated.\nStudents will have access to a form to assign a score to each presentation along various dimensions (TBA).\n\n\n\nAbout the Conference\n\nStudents are expected to attend the entire conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?
